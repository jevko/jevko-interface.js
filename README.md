# jevko-interface.js

A [Jevko](https://jevko.org) Interface library in JavaScript.

Provides functionality to manage various Jevko formats.

Currently supports [.jevkoml](https://github.com/jevko/jevkoml), [.jevkodata](https://github.com/jevko/jevkodata), [.jevkocfg](https://github.com/jevko/jevkoconfig1.js).

Can convert the Jevko formats into well-known and well-supported formats (e.g. JSON, HTML, XML and XML-based formats, such as SVG).

Can also convert from JSON to .jevkodata. 

<!-- More conversion options are planned. -->

Can be used for making tools such as CLIs, code editor plugins, etc.

These tools in turn can be used to easily integrate Jevko formats into applications that deal with XML or JSON, providing facilities that can make authoring and maintaining HTML documents, XML or JSON configurations, SVG graphics, and countless XML-based formats much more enjoyable -- Jevko formats are generally much more pleasant to read, write, edit, or generate -- by hand or otherwise.
